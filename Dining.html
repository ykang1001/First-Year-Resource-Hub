    <h3>Meal Plans</h3>
    <div style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><body>
      The university offers a variety of meal plans that differ in swipes and declining.
      Swipes can be used at both dining halls and during limited times at the Pit.
      Declining works like a debit card and can be used at any dining location.
      You can refill your declining balance at any time and it will roll over from fall to spring.
      Based on where you live there are requirements for the minimum dining plan you can choose.
      Most first-years pick the Meliora Unlimited or Blue Unlimited plan.

    <h3>Dining Locations</h3>
    <div style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><body>There are lots of places to eat on campus.
      Douglass Dining and Danforth Dining Center are the most popular at meal times. The menu for each location is updated twice daily with what's being served.
      Starbucks, Connections, and Peet's are the go-to for a quick snack or coffee.
      The Pit is popular for late night dining, but is open all day.
      Hillside Market is our on-campus convenience store where you can buy anything from apples to ice cream to toothpaste to pens.

      You can order food ahead of time and pick it up using the GrubHub app and your declining.
      To set up campus ordering, open Grubhub, go to settings, click "Campus Dining", select "University of Rochester" and enter your class year.
      You can add your declining balance as a method of payment.
      Grubhub ordering is available everywhere except Douglass and Danforth.
