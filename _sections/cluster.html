<h3>What is the Cluster System?</h3><br>

  Clusters are sets of related courses. Each cluster contains a minimum of twelve credits of coursework,
  which is equivalent, in most cases, to three courses. There are three main academic divisions in the College:
  Humanities, Social Sciences, Natural Sciences and Engineering. If you plan to major in Computer Science, you will
  need 2 clusters: Humanities and Social Sciences because CS falls under the Natural Sciences and Engineering division.
  Each cluster, like mentioned at the beginning, is 12 credits or approximately 3 courses (assuming each course is 4 credit).
  That means you will need 2 clusters = 6 courses to complete your cluster requirement! This helps you explore other
  courses at other divisions of the college. To figure out which cluster you are interested in choosing, you
  will use the cluster engine! Keep reading below to learn about how to use the cluster engine :)

      <h3>Step 1: This is the homepage of the cluster search engine. First, click on "All Divisions" and click on the one
        you're interested in. After that, if you don't really have anything specific, you can click "Find Clusters"

      <h3>Step 2: I have clicked on Humanities division as an example. You can see here that there are two buttons at the top.
        The first button ("Return To Search") brings you back to the homepage and the second button ("Show Expired") will either
        hide or show the expired classes/clusters. You don't want to see expired clusters/classes, so you should leave it as "Show Expired"
        Next, the list shown in the image below the two buttons are the clusters you can choose. You can choose to click
        on each one and it will direct you to that section or you can scroll down to see all the options!

      <h3>Step 3: Let's take this cluster as an example. The description of the cluster is right below the header. If you
        are interested in this cluster, you will have to take all 3 classes in the required section. There are no other 
        options for this cluster. After these 3 classes are taken and passed with a C or better, you have fulfilled this cluster!
