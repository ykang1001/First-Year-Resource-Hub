          they will ask your name and birthday to confirm identity, then they find a time for you to come in for an appointment that works with your schedule. You may also have to provide
          a reason for the visit, which can be as vague or specific as you want. Afterward, you can contact your PCP via UHS Connect, the online messaging and forms system.
